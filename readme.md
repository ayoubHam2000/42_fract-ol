## Key Concepts

- Fractal
- Complex numbers
- Cuda

## Fractal

A fractal is a fragmented geometrical figure that infinitely repeats itself at smaller scales.

## Mandalbrot set

The Mandelbrot set is an example of a fractal in mathematics. It is named after Beno√Æt Mandelbrot, a Polish-French-American mathematician.
The Mandelbrot set can be explained with the equation
| $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$ |
In that equation, `c` and `z` are complex numbers.\
`c` is in the Mandelbrot set if the absolute value of $ z_n $ never becomes larger than a certain number no matter how large `n` gets. \
Depending on the iteration number at which c becomes larger than that value, a color can be chosen to visualize the Mandelbrot fractal.

## Features

## Installing and Compiling Fract-ol

```
# Install SDL2 and SDL2-images
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev

make
./fractol 1000 100 1

# For cuda version

Install CUDA toolkit then
cd cuda_mandelbrot
make
```
